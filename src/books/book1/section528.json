He sees you glance at it, and his hand starts towards his sword-hilt. You dive forwards, somersaulting nimbly and snatching up the RUSTY SWORD as you do. His own SWORD is half way out of its scabbard. You hurl your new-found weapon at his throat. His sword is drawn at the instant he is impaled. He falls in a rain of blood.",
