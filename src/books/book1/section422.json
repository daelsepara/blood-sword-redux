The Thegns are dashing figures in elegant armour -- an odd contrast to the sombre, sour-faced old Sacerdotes who stand beside them. The graven faces of the Lord and Lady almost shine with regal dignity.\n\nYou are not given much chance to admire the craftsmanship. A hail of arrows suddenly zings down all around you. Two find their target.",
