    "text": "As you step on to the smooth pebbles marking the shore of the lake, ripples spread across its glistening surface and a gondola wrapped in dark-blue drapes slides into view across the water. As it draws nearer, a gondolier becomes visible at the back of the boat. Somehow you failed to notice him at first. He works his oar with thin but apparently tireless arms. He brings the gondola to a halt in front of you. Ripples lap up the shore, producing an eerie echoing shush-shush, like a greate creature breathing deeply in its sleep.\n\nYou watch the gondolier. His scrawny frame is wrapped in odd folds of cloth. His face is hidden by one of the despdondent theatrical masks used in Ancient Emphidian tragedies. He waits in silence.",
