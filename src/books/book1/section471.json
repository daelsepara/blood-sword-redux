He has a small, cruel, thick-lipped mouth.\n\n\"Let us speak frankly,\" he says in a cold voice. \"I am not much interested in the contest. I have made arrangements with several other magi and thus gained numerous concessions. I do not need to win tomorrow, so I have decided to have a little sport.\" Suddenly he sits bolt upright and claps his hands down on the arms of the throne. \"Let's have a game! I like playing games. What do you want to play? How about Old Man of the Mountain? Or there's Frey's Roosters, but that's not really as much fun.\"",
