The sound of dripping water reaches your ears and soon you are standing in a damp stairwell, with a single bricked archway in front of you and a tunnel leading off behind it. You follow the tunnel for a few steps then find another tunnel leading off to the right. As you peer down it you fancy you can make out a motionless figure standing in the gloom. Ahead, you can see that the passage ends in a huge ornamental doorway.",
