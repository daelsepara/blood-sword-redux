    "text": "You lift the olive-green pennant. \"You have chosen the standard of Magus Kalugen, overlord of this city,\" declares Kalugen's steward grandly. \"I am to escort you to his palace, the House of the Fivefold Torments. There you will be received witht he honor due to you.\"\n\nAs he speaks, a number of soldiers draw up around you and you find that they are leading you off through the winding dark alleways of the city. The jostling crowds miraculously melt away when they see the olive-green livery of the soldiers, and you soon find yourself walking through the main gate of Kalugen's palace, a massive, fire-blackened mansion house with heavily barred windows and a high ordure-stained tower rising in one of its corners.\n\nThe greate gate of the mansion is swung shut behind you and you find yourself in a courtyard crowded with a group of raggedly dressed people waiting in line, clutching the petitions they hope to present to Kalugen. You are ushered through this mob into a dark hall whose ceiling is lost in the sooty gloom. You are led to the far end of it, where you can dimly make out a seated figure on a throne. You instinctively recognise him as Kalugen.",
