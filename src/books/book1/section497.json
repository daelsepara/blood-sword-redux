Its long-dead features acquire a look of astonishment, then black rage. It easily resists the power of the Exorcism, drawing energy from the cosmic flux into itself until it blazes like a human torch.\n\n\"You dare to assail the spirit of Zyn?\" it hisses. \"Begone!\" It gestures, and a crackling web of mystical lightning envelops you. You stream at an instant of blinding agony.",
