He realises what you're doing, however, and suddenly grabs your hand, shifting his weight heavily against you as he does so.\n\n\"Nice to live again,\" he hisses, his face pressed close to yours, \"but that isn't as important as killing you.\" Holding tightly to your arm, he leaps out into space, and the two of you fall to your doom together in the gorge below.",
