At the bottom of the steps a slab of grey rock with a sculpted frieze running round it forms a low dais. Looking beyond this, you see four sarcophagi carved on a monumental scale. Further on, you can dimly make out a pebble beach washed by the dark waters of an underground lake. Catiously you make your way down the steps.",
