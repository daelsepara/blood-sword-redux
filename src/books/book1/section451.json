    "text": "\"Behold the fires of the Battlepits,\" says the ghost, sweeping its translucent arm to indicate the mist-shrouded volcanic vista below. \"Cold rock lies like a coffin lid, draped with a grave-cloth of mist. But underneath, the very fires of the Inferno rage and seethe. Sot it is with me. I am dead, my mortal shell but ashes, but my spirt burns with the accumulated hatred and ferocity of a millennial vengeance. You have thwarted me temporarily, for an instant in the eternity of my existence, but I shall see to it that your suffering screams endure throughout all time.\"\n\nAs it summons fiends from the darkest hell to torture and torment you, you know that your quest is at an end. But the agony is just beginning.",
