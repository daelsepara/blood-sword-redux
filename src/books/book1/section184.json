Strangely, no one in the room seems to take any notice except for a fellow in a black domino cape. You gaze around in astonishment. A hunched man in a gold tunic is pouring himself a glass of wine, oblivious of the disturbance. A man in a green wig goes on laughing at a friend's joke as though he had not noticed the battle at all. A masquerade jester proceeds with his antics, and a man adorned in the laurel wreath of a Sage of Ancient Selentium has eyes only for the serving-girls.\n\nOne of these men is Balhazar. Which one?",
