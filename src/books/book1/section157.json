    "text": "(SAGE) You step out on the bridge and begin to make your way along it. You look down to see a surging river of miasma gushing along the bottom of the gorge a hundred metres below. Just as you reach the mid-point of the bridge, the gargoyle's head speaks again. \"Be mortal again,\" it says.\n\nAs if in answer, a dark shape begins to form on the bridge in front of you. Within moments, it is a thin pale woman who stands there. She sweeps forwards, drawing a sharp steel sword from under her torn black robs. Her eyes glimmer with recognition at the same instant that yours do. She is NEMESIS, whose mother was a demon and whose father was a mortal man. She was your bitterest foe -- until the day you took her life, six years ago.\n\n\"Life and death are not immutable,\" groans the gargoyle. \"Fight to decide who shall live.\"\n\nNEMESIS gives a slight bow, which turns into a forward roll as she closes to strike. Her sword slashes your arm.",
