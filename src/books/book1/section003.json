Suddenly a black-gloved hand appears on the window-sill and the masked face of an assasin rises into view.\n\nThe assassins you fled from have climbed the outer wall of th tower in their determination to slay you. Any that you did not slay in the fight at the bottom of the tower will now attempt again to murder you. By means of the arcane herbal drugs of their secret society, those that survived the earlier encounter have healed themselves back up.",
