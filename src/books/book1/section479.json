Ahead, the ruined shrine looms in the darkness.\n\nA scrabbling noise causes your pulse to quicken. You fancy you saw the flutter of a white robe up ahead. Suddenly you see hunched shapes clambering on to the path behind and ahead of you. Your attackers are Death Fetishists, bodies daubed with grey corpse-paint and with horrific death-masks hiding their faces. They weild their bone-handled falchions with a skill and deadly speed born of fanaticism.",
