A blond-wigged man dressed like a Marcanian reaver enters from the garden with a slim young lady on his arm. You notice two men standing beside a fountain in earnest conversation: one is dressed like a torturer, the other like a perfumed dandy. On a chaise-longue, you notice a fellow in a domino cape romancing a girl in black velvet.\n\nWhom will you approach?",
