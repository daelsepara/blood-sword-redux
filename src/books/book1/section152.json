One is directly ahead of you: a rough rectangular opening in the stonework barred by a heavy iron grille with an even heavier iron chain and padlock sealing it. The other exit leads off to your right, where you can see an archway and a corridor lit with torches in brackets. The corridor leads to a door. There are deep alcoves all along the corridor on either side.",
