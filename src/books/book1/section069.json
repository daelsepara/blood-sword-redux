There's three still wantin' champions fer the contest -- that's their pennants over by that booth. Magus Vyl is the worst o'the lot, but then 'e's a vampre an' I shouldn't speek ill o' the dead. Kalugen -- lord o' this city, as you'll know -- well, 'e ain't much better, an' he is not in the contest to win, I've 'eard. But the third -- Magus Balhazar -- is the best of a bad bunch, 'cause 'e's got most to lose in the contest, an' 'e'll be rewardin' 'is champions the best on account o' that.\"\n\nAny hopes you might have of questioning the merchant further are soon dashed. Exhausted by the effort of speaking, he favours you with a broad grin then falls like a plank on the cobblestones. A boot in the ribs does nothing to rouse him from his drunken stupor, so you decide to approach the booth.",
