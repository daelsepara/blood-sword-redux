A moment later it hovers at your side once more. \"The other items are beyond my reach,\" it whispers, \"but I tried to obtain them and that was what we agreed. I now depart.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" you snarl. \"Impudent imp! Malicious sprite!\" But it is too late. The faltyn has vanished, taking with it Larisha's gift.",
