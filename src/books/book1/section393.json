Probably it was once a human who transgressed in some way against the magi of Krarth, and as punishment was translated into this monstrous form. From what you have heard, so dire a fate would be meteted out only to the most treacherous of Krarthian wrongdoers. Krarthian justice is far from just, but at least most criminals are given the mercy of a quick death.]",
