You call them over, saying, \"If you wish to earn a bag of silver for very little effort, come here. I have been told to guard the pennant of Magus Vyl but now remembar an urgent errand. Hold the pennant until I return, and I will reward you lavishly. This I swear, or I am not the Grand Treasurer of the House of Vyl.\"\n\nYou walk a little distance off into the shadows, then double back.
