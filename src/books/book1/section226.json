You do not have the expertise to use them properly, but you can take them anyway.\n\nA more interesting item is a long thin sword of CRESCENTIUM STEEL SWORD. This is so flexible that it can be worn wrapped around the waist under a belt which is presumably why the dead assassin thought it was useful.\n\nYou also find a SMALL BOTTLE OF MAUVE LIQUID.\n\nYou return to the main square and see if you have better luck finding a patron.",
