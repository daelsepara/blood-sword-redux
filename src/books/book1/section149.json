He hesitates for a fatal split second too long, giving the assassin time to throw his dagger. It spins in the air and impales Balhazar in the arm. Shocked, he pulls it free. You see that the dagger glistens with a coating of poison. Balhazar staggers and falls.\n\nYou turn to deal with the assassin. To your amazement he has scaled a long drape and now stands at a window on the balcony above. You make for the stairs, but he hurls three spiked sha-ken in quick succession to delay you. Then he is gone into the night.\n\nYou go over to Balhazar. \"My magic will not cure this poison,\" he says weakly. \"The assassin must have been sent by my rival, Magus Vyl. He employs an entire network of the scum.\" Balhazar coughs, obviously near death. \"My demise deprives you of an employer. I hear that only Kalugen is still looking for champions, so you must return and take his pennant. I can perform but one service for you. Open the cabinet yonder and take what you find within.\"\n\nHe dies.",
