A desperate, insane laugh seems to waver at the edge of your hearing. Your skin crawls with a terror you cannot define. The blue light is causing your armor to rot and slough away.\n\nYou are not alone in this room. An indistinct, shimmering figure is now beside you. It is the creature known in Krarthian mythology as the Prince of Desolation. Hemoves in front of you and a mad leer swims before your eyes.",
