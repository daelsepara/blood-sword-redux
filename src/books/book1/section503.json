Another party may have come that way, but the grille is too high for you to reach.\n\nFurther on you pass an iron door studded with opals. One of the opals has beenprised out, and there is a pool of sticky stuff on the floor nearby in which the stolen opal rests ominously. You cannot open this door, so you continue to make your way along the corridor.\n\nAt last you come to a gothic-arched vestibule where the corridor splits in two. Above the junction of the two branches a carving decorates the wall. It shows a man's head in simple outline, a profile view with him looking to your left. A series of lines radiates from the head like spokes from the hub of a wheel.",
