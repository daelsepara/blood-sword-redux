    "text": "You look around the room for distinctive mannerisms. You notice a portly man caressing his wine glass. In the frame of the doorway to the lawn, a thin fellow in a green wig is licking his lips as he talks to two servants. There is a man nearby who has the habit of tugging at his earlobe while holding forth about the current political situation in Kurland. Another man, dressed in a long blue robe, rubs his hands silently while contemplating the many delicious snacks laid out on the table. On a chaise-longue in the corner, a man in a domino cape strokes his moustache as he talks quietly to a velvet-clad woman in a feline mask.\n\nWhom will you approach?",
