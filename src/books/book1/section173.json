You feel the sensation of gravity's tug fade away and, weightless, you drift into the air. In your serene state you are disinterestedly aware that your foe, having lunged just as you rose up into mid-air, has fallen from the bridge into the gorge. You feel this thought pulling you back to reality, and you slowly settle down on to the bridge once more.",
