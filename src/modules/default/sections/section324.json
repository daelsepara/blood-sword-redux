You also get a taste of it as you swim across, and it is unpleasantly brackish. Ignoring one dank, eerie, side tunnel that looks a particularly dangerous route, you eventually reach the far side of the lake and scramble up on to a rough stone jetty. Immersion in the lake exposed you to its baneful properties.",
