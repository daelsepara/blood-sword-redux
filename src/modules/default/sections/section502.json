    "text": "You heave the chain up. It is quite heavy. At last you haul the end into view and see that it is attached to an iron cage containing a mire-coated human skeleton. The skeleton wears an emerald scarab around its fleshless neck, but when you reach out to snatch this amulet you get an unpleasant shock. The skull's eye-sockets uddenly blze with green light, startling you into releasing your grip on the chain. As your grisly haul slips back below the water, a flickering green eidolon arises from the bones and hovers beside the boat.\n\n\"Free!\" it roars in a hollow voice. A hideous rictus spreads across its ghastly face. \"Freed by mortal hand, as was prophesied. Now I shall complete the prophesy.\" Spectral talons reach out to clutch you.",
