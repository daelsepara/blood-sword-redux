The column of light streams around you, and you feel the Teleportation spell taking effect. You are conveyed to the Great Hall where the magi have assembled to applaud your victory.\n\nYou are approached first by Magus Tor. \"I speak on behalf of all the magi\", he declares. \"You have achieved far more than the winning of the annual contest. You have overcome our ancestral foe, dread Skrymir. For this you shall be rewarded most lavishly.\"",
