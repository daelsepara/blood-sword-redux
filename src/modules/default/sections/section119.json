You are relieved to see that one pennant remains, however: the olive-green banner of Magus Kalugen, who rules this city.

As you stride over, he looks up. \"The hour is late and I am cold,\" he says. \"Take this banner and let me go home.\"\n\nYou are just about to do so when another hand, velvet-gloved and bearing many white gold rings, reaches out to snatch it.\n\n\"I shall be Kalugen's champion,\" states the newcomer. He appears to be an Enchanter. He turns to smile at you, a very cold and sinister smile. \"I am Dominus Quel. And you -- you are dust if you try to oppose me.\"",
