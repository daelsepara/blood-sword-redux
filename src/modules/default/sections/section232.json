The faltyn imposes its voice tunefully over the music of the harps and flutes, but only you can hear what it is saying.\n\n[\"I arrive at a moment of merriment,\" it sings. \"Have you invited me here to share the food and wine? Of course not, for I am ethereal and need no earthly sustenance. To entertain you with my rarefied and beautiful songs, then? No, for you are a loutish mortal with no appreciation of beauty. Ah, now I understand -- you wish me to locate a magus among these masked revellers.\"]",
