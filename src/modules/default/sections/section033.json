When all the sections of the skeleton are in place, a cold dry wind whips up around the atoll, keening hungrily. Skrymir's soul is returning from the dead.\n\nPatches of flesh-mould appear on the sere bones. A spark of life-light gleams inside the sockets of the skull. Veins and sinews spread, glistening tendrils, as the body re-forms from dust.\n\nSkrymir rises to stand before you, the iron frame now forming a suit of armour around his powerfully muscled body. He looks upon you as a man watches a fly. \"I have no heart!\" he bellows. \"You have neglected the heart of Skrymir! I must take yours instead!\"",
