You address him in the Ancient Emphidian language [saying: \"Most revered Keron, you who alone ride the ebb and flow of the two worlds, who alone remained untouched by the parting of life and death, I charge you by the Fifty and Three Paradoxes of Kerberos to provide passage to the far bank of this river.\"]\n\nKeron cannot refuse your deman, phrased as it is in the arcane formulae prescribed in the ancient texts. He indicates for you to step into his boat, then sculls out across the dark lake.",
