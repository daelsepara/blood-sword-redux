Rather than fleeing like a scoundrel, you simply step quickly behind a stall and pull a piece of sackcloth from a carton of fruit.\n\nWrapping yourself ini the sackcloth, you lie down in the gutter and begin to snore.

He looks to and fro, baffled at your disappearance, then plods off down the street calling for his comrades to join the hunt.]\n\nAs you return to the square, a tall man in scarlet robes steps from the booth.
