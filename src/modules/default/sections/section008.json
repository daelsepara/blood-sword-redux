The shore of the lake is covered with several large mounds made of piled stones. These look to you suspiciously like graves. You can also see in your torchlight a large block of murky ice, and beyond that there is the dull glow of red ritual candles that cast faint light on a bronze shrine that has been set up against one of the cavern walls. Fiercely burning braziers stand to either side of the shrine.\n\nYou now have a number of options.",
