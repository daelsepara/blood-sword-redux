    "text": "You step towards the man dressed in dark blue. As you start to address him, he gives a cry of mingled surprise and rage. He flings down his goblet and runs for the door, drawing a long knife from a concealed pocket in his cloak as he does so.\n\n\"Stop that man,\" yells an imposing figure in a black domino cape. Immediately, guards pour in from the colonnade outside and corner him. The man in the black domino cape comes over to you.\n\n\"You have flushed out an assassin who was doubtless sent by one of my rival magi,\" he says. You recognise Balhazar by his voice even before he unmasks. \"Unfortunately, you only did so inadvertently. You obviously thought you had identified me. For possibly saving my life, I give you this amulet sacred to Osiris -- which may save your own.\"\n\nHe hands you an EMERALD scarab.\n\n\"For failing to identify me,\" continues Balhazar, \"I must reject your application to champion me in tomorrow's contest. I wish you luck finding a sponsor elsewhere. My usher will show you out.\"",
