Nearby, pouring wine into his mouth from a long-stemmed glass, there is a short fat man in grey furs. You notice one fellow in a green wig who seems to be tall, but this may be because he's very thin. A large man dressed in a bear costume sweeps past swinging a bell, and he seems to be the tallest person present.\n\nWhom will you approach?",
