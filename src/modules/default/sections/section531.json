    "text": "You lost your momentum when you saw the jewelled sword, and although you try to set off again you realise that the barbarians are going to be on top of you within seconds. You stop and face them, expecting the worst. Seeing you stop, they slow themselves and with sly grins advance towards you -- hefting their battle-axes while they look you up and down much as a butcher would scrutinise a consignment of meat. Suddenly one of them spots the jewelled sword lying in the middle of the corridor. Without taking his eyes off you, he stoops to pick it up. As he does so a wall instantaneously appears in front of you, blocking off the barbarians. Listening, you hear their bellows of rage. You realise that the sword must have had some kind of a spell on it which has created this magical barrier. You haven't got the sword, but at least you are still alive. You continue down the corridor.",
