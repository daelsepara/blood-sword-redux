Passing one of the stone monoliths, you make a quick detour to investigate it. The ancient sigils that cover its cracked surface seem alive with mystical power, but it is power that is closed to you. Even the modern magi cannot read these immemorial runes, carved two centuries ago by the True Magi, who were slain in the eruption that destroyed the unholy city of Spyte.\n\n\"What do they say, I wonder?\" A voice behind you makes you start. You turn to see the black-armoured warlock who champions Magus Uru. He makes no aggressive move but bows, saying, \"Icon, sometimes called the Ungodly, at your service. I have seen what is ahead, and I believe that if we unite together we stand a chance of reaching the Emblem of Victory. Separately we shall surely fail. I suggest an alliance, which is permitted by the rules of the contest, as you know. We shall have to share the prize, but even a shared prize is more than enough to make us rich.\"",
