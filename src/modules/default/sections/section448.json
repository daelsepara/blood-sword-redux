Although it is difficult to pick them up, you eventually register the limited thoughts of the barbarians as they progress down the corridor. There is a brief surge of mental energy as they appear to reach a branch in the corridor and have to decide what to do next. They then divid into two groups. The right-hand group of thoughts seem to be approaching another set of thought-processes somewhat more powerful than their own. The barbarians are apparently not aware that this other group lies in front of them.",
