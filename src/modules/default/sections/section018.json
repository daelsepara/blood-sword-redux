    "text": "(SAGE) You have spent years studying a hundred tomes and crumbling parchments full of ancient knowledge. Surely somewhere you must have read something concerning the magi of Krarth? You clear your mind of all distractions, and gradually the din of the crowds fades away. You see countless old documents with your inner eye, and mentally sift them until you have found what you seek.\n\n[The olive-green pennant represents Magus Kalugen, who is overlord of this citadel. A man of notorious cruelty, he has already won so many concessions this year from his fellow magi that he stands to gain very little from winning the contest. Magus Balhazar, whose pennant is a brilliant scarlet, is in quite the opposite position. He desperately needs to win the contest or he will have to cede much of his land -- including thousands of acres of valuable pine forest -- to his rivals. Magus Vyl is perhaps rather appropriately represented by a pennant of sombre black and purple. He is widely reputed to be one of the undead -- a vampire who shuns the daylight and stalk the night in search of blood.]",
