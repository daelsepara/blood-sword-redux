The skiapyrs stop, wavering like guttering candles. \"The talisman,\" says one, its voice a suft susurration of air. \"We await your wishes.\"\n\n\"Slay the brigands that pursue us,\" you command.

As they do, their fiery faces change from expressions of serene obedience to masks of hate. \"Slay the interlopers!\" they shriek, reaching out with white-hot claws. In moments, only charred bones and the stench of roasted flesh remain to show that the adventurers ever existed.\n\nNo, not only that.

When you go to investigate you find a GILDED BRIDLE.",
