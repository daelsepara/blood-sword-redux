The light it sheds shows that you have reached a T-junction. From here you could go left or right. As you are making up your mind, you hear a great booming laugh coming from the left-hand branch of the corridor.\n\n\"Ho, Lars,\" says one voice. \"We sure suffed those little assassins, huh?\"\n\nThere is more laughter. \"That's true, Erek,\" comes the reply. \"All their fancy jumps and kicks and little pointy stars didn't rate much against a good Mercanian axe in the belly.\"\n\n\"This is a walkover,\" says another bellowing voice. \"Not haf as dangerous as Deathr-- Wait! Someone up ahead, lads.\"\n\nIt seems a group of battle-crazy barbarians is blundering along towards you. You can just make out their silhouettes in the gloom.",
